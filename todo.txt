# objective: dial it in; slow down

- screen to remote monitor
- auto revert to base snapshot before install; maintain user file integrity
- file hash files for "Nothing to do" state to happen quickly


**Critical System Foundation (Do First):**
- Update system and enable multilib repository
	- latest packages, security updates
	- setup multilib in /etc/pacman.conf, for 32-bit packages; gaming/wine/propietary soft
	- refresh package dabases (pacman -Sy)

- Install and configure bootloader properly (if not done during install)
	- verify bootloader is actually installed to the ESP
	- check /boot/loader/entries or /boot/grub/grub.cfg exists and correct
	- test boot without install media
	- configure boot timeout and default entries
- Set up network connectivity (NetworkManager/systemd-networkd)
	- networkmanager/systemd-networkd
	- test wifi & wired
	- configuer dns resolution
- Configure users, sudo, and basic security
	- non-root user (useradd -m -G wheel username)
	- user password
	- visudo with wheel
	- sudo test
	- ssh, disable root login
- Install essential firmware packages (linux-firmware, any vendor-specific firmware)

**Hardware Detection & Drivers:**
- Graphics drivers (intel-media-driver, mesa, nvidia, amdgpu)
- Audio system (pipewire-pulse, wireplumber, alsa-utils)
- Bluetooth stack (bluez, bluez-utils)
- Input devices (libinput, any special keyboard/mouse drivers)
- Printer support if needed (cups)

**Power & Thermal Management:**
- Power management (tlp, powertop, or laptop-mode-tools)
- CPU frequency scaling (cpupower)
- Thermal monitoring (lm-sensors, thermald)
- Suspend/hibernate configuration

**Hardware Verification Testing:**
- Test all USB ports and devices
- Verify display outputs and resolutions
- Check audio input/output on all jacks
- Test wireless connectivity strength
- Verify suspend/resume cycles
- Check thermal throttling under load

**System Monitoring Setup:**
- Install hardware monitoring tools (htop, iotop, lm-sensors)
- Set up logging for hardware issues (journalctl configuration)
- Install stress testing tools (stress, s-tui)

**Only Then Move To:**
- Desktop environment/window manager
- Application installation
- Dotfiles and aesthetics
- Custom scripts and automation

The key is getting hardware working reliably before layering on complexity. Each step should be tested before moving to the next.
